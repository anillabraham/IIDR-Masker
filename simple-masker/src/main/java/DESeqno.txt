This is a modified version of DESeqno, originally published as
"Derived Sequence User Exit Sample".
The original version should NOT be used in audit mode table mappings,
as it sometimes provides inconsistent results.

DESeqno.class will return a 13 byte character string
which can be used to populate a CHAR(13) FOR BIT column
or a CHAR(13) variant (VARCHAR,etc).

These values should only be used to order the operations
inside a single transaction (e.g. entries having the same
&CCID values). The value ranges:
 - CAN and WILL OVERLAP between CDC agent startups;
 - CANNOT be compared in a meaningful way for the records
   corresponding to different transactions.

To use it:

1)	Copy DESeqno.class to the /lib folder of the CDC install directory.
2)	Map your target column to a user exit using %USERFUNC("JAVA","DESeqno",null)
